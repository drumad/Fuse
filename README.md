# Fuse
From Code Katas: https://github.com/cahcommercial/fuse-kata
I was able to complete 6 problems:
1. GameOfLife
2. Minesweeper
3. Yahtzee
4. Bowling
5. PokerHands
6. TexasHoldEm

TDD-approach, I used IntelliJ IDE to develop, and may require to add "src/test/inputfiles" as a test resource folder,
or add it as part of the classpath.

Thank you!
